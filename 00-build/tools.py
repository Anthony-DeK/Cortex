"""Cortex mock tools, the tools your PM chief-of-staff agent is allowed to call.

These are plain Python functions over the files in `fixtures/`. They are imported
directly by `agent.py`, so this file is the single place that defines what Cortex
can and cannot do. Ask your coding agent to add, remove, or tighten a tool here.

Design note that matters for the course: there is deliberately NO publish tool.
Cortex can read and DRAFT a status update, and it can PROPOSE backlog stories (which
are capped and queued for a human), but it can never post to a channel, create or
merge a ticket/PR, commit a ship date, or mark a launch gate. The agent line is
enforced here, in infrastructure, not by a prompt.
